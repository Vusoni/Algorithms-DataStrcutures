Algorithms & Data Structures Sandbox (JavaScript)

This repository is my personal learning playground for exploring algorithms and data structures using JavaScript. It contains practice implementations, experiments, and notes created as part of my self-study process.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This code is not intended for production use — it’s purely an educational sandbox where I test concepts, make mistakes, and improve over time.

💡 Topics covered:
	•	Fundamental data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs)
	•	Sorting & searching algorithms
	•	Recursion and complexity analysis
	•	LeetCode-style practice problems
